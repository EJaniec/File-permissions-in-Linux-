<h1>Activity: Manange Authorization</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
In this lab activity, the central objective was to employ Linux commands for configuring authorization, a pivotal aspect of system security. The concept of authorization, crucial for preventing security risks, was emphasized, highlighting the potential threats if users could access and modify files without proper constraints. The lab focused on exploring file and directory permissions in Linux, with participants gaining practical experience in specifying access rights for different users. Additionally, the lab included tasks such as changing ownership of a file and a directory to strategically limit accessâ€”a key responsibility for a security analyst. The overarching goal was to instill the significance of setting appropriate access permissions in safeguarding sensitive information and bolstering the overall security posture of the system. Participants, assuming the role of security analysts, engaged in hands-on activities to configure robust access controls, aligning with best practices in securing Linux environments.
